<p class="event1"> You might be wondering who made python? Python was made by Dutch programmer Guido Van Rossum in the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands. Started in 1989, it official release to the public was in 1991. Guido made python as a hobby project he would do over the holidays. Guido derived python from many other languages like ABC,C and C++,etc. But what he made incorperated these languages, was much simplier to understand, and fixed the limitations that other languages had.</p>
