<p class="introduction"> Python is a high level programming language that is one of the best and easist to use coding languages. This make it easier for more people to understand and learn it, however, you might be thinking, how did python come to be? What was the process of its development and who were important names in its creation? Well if you are asking this, your in luck, as here we will explain all this and you will know more about one of the best coding languages.</p>
<h3 class="event1_title"> Creation of Python</h3> <img class="img1" src="download (4).jpeg"> <img class="img2" src="BPython_reference.png">
<p class="event1"> You might be wondering who made python? Python was made by Dutch programmer Guido Van Rossum in the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands. Started in 1989, it official release to the public was in 1991. Guido made python as a hobby project he would do over the holidays. Guido derived python from many other languages like ABC,C and C++,etc. But what he made incorperated these languages, was much simplier to understand, and fixed the limitations that other languages had.</p>
<h3 class=""event2_title> Python 0.9.0-1.0 </h3> <img class="gif1" src="ghostedvpn-hacker-cat.gif"><img class="img3" src="download (6).jpeg">
<p class="event2"> Python 0.9.0 was the first version of python released in 1991. By only this first version, it already had things like core data types (ex. lists, dictionaries) ,exception handling, functions, classes with inheritance. </p>
<h3 class="event3_title"> Python 2.0-present version</h3> <img class="img4" src="download (5).jpeg">
<p class="event3"> In 2000, versiom 2.0 of python was released, with new features like unicode support, list comprehension, and garbage collection. Useful libraries like NumPy,SciPy, and more were also developed in this version. For many years during the 2000's this version of python was incredibly popular, with great traction in industries from web development all the way to scientific research. In 2008, Python 3.0 was released, revamping the langauge. It ws primarily made to remove discrepancies in python 2.0 versions, and it also faciliated transition between 2.0 and 3.0. Some of it's features include new syntax, more unicode support, and improved integer division.Today, small mirco-updates occur adding more small features to python. The current version of python as of November 23, 2025 is Python 3.11.2, released in February 2023.</p>
